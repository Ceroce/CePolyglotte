{"name":"Cepolyglotte","body":"CePolyglotte performs on-the-fly translation of NIB files.\r\n\r\n### Supported OS X versions\r\n\r\nCePolyglotte is used in an application of my own that runs under Mac OS 10.5, 10.6 and 10.7.\r\n\r\n# Purpose\r\n\r\nWhen translating a Mac application, Apple proposes you create a translated version of every XIB file. For instance, if an application sported English and French, you would have two directories (en.lproj and fr.lproj) each one containing translated versions of the XIBs.\r\n\r\nThis principle provides a precise control of the layout of views for every language, however it has three drawbacks:\r\n\r\n* NIB files get multiplied, which makes your app fat.\r\n* The translator needs to use Xcode which is difficult and error prone.\r\n* Every time a change is made to a XIB, the change needs be made in every localised versions of the XIB.\r\n\r\nThis third reason makes translation unsustainable: imagine you add a checkbox in the English version and set bindings. You would have to do the same for every translated versions of the XIB.\r\nMy own experience is, because I may change a XIB a lot for a single revision, I would better delete the translated XIBs, do my work on the English version, and translate the XIB again from zero.\r\n\r\nCePolyglotte is a response to these problems: once a XIB is loaded, texts of controls and menus are replaced with strings read from a _.strings_ file.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n# Instructions\r\n\r\nFirst, put CePolyglotte.h and CePolyglotte.m into your Xcode project.\r\n\r\nThen do the following for every XIB file to translate:\r\n\r\n## Create an instance of CePolyglotte in the XIB\r\nIn Xcode 4 > Object library (bottom right), locate _Object_ (a blue cube), and drag it to the XIB.\r\nChange its class from _NSObjet_ to _CePolyglotte_, using the Identity inspector (top right, 3rd tab).\r\n\r\n## Provide the top-level object(s)\r\nThe Polyglotte needs to get to the object which is the parent of the objects hierarchy. For that purpose it has three outlets:\r\n\r\n* topLevelMenu is a NSMenu. This menu and every submenus will be translated.\r\n* topLevelWindow is a NSWindow. This window and all its subviews will be translated.\r\n* topLevelView is a NSView. This view and all its subviews will be translated.\r\n\r\nOnly the necessary outlets need be connected. For instance, in MainWindow.xib, you would only connect topLevelMenu to the application's menu bar, and topLevelWindow to the main window.\r\n\r\n## (Optionally) Provide the .strings file name\r\n\r\nBy default, translations are looked up in Localizable.strings. However, you may provide an other file name, and I strongly recommend you do so. By the way, using the same name for the .string file and the .xib file is a great idea.\r\n\r\nFor that purpose, you would typically set the XIB's controller as the delegate of the Polyglotte, by connecting its _delegate_ outlet to the _File's owner_. Then, in the controller's code, implement the _localizedStringsFile_ method.\r\nE.g., to look up translations in _FormatSheetController.strings_:\r\n\r\n\t// MARK: CePolyglotteDelegate methods\r\n\t- (NSString *) localizedStringsFile\r\n\t{\r\n\t    return @\"FormatSheetController\";\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\r\nThis method is defined by the CePolyglotteDelegate protocol, but you do not have to explicitly declare that your controller conforms to this protocol.\r\n\r\n## Replace texts with keys in the XIB\r\n\r\nThe titles are used as keys in the strings file. For instance, you could set the title of a _Cancel button_ to _cancelBtn_.\r\n\r\n## Provide the .strings file\r\n\r\nThis is a usual string file.\r\ne.g.:\r\n\r\n/en.lproj/FormatSheetController.strings\r\n\r\n\t\"cancelBtn\" = \"Cancel\";\r\n\r\n/fr.lproj/FormatSheetController.strings\r\n\r\n\t\"cancelBtn\" = \"Annuler\";\r\n\r\n# Features\r\n\r\n## Supported\r\n\r\n* Controls: NSBox, NSButton, NSSegmentedControl, NSTextField\r\n* Table views: NSTableColumn title\r\n* Tooltips\r\n* Menus\r\n* Window title and toolbars\r\n\r\n## Not supported yet\r\n\r\n* Text bindings\r\n* NSMatrices\r\n* Maybe some objects I might have forgotten (please let me know).\r\n* Resizing (make your controls large enough for translations to fit!)\r\n","tagline":"On-the-fly translation of NIB files on Mac OS X ","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
